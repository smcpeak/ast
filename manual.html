<p class="title"><b>AST Manual</b></p>

<p>
astgen is a simple tool for creating C++ data type descriptions of
heterogenous tree structures.  "ast" comes from the common use of
heterogeneous trees to make abstract syntax trees for compilers.  This
page is its documentation.  <a href="index.html">Another page</a>
describes the module structure of its implementation.

<p>Fair warning: The astgen input language was developed "bottom up",
adding features and wrinkles as needs arose.  Consequently, it is
fairly concise in practice, but sort of awkard to describe.  There are
several instances of incomplete orthogonalization ("irregularities").
It's probably time for a redesign; but for now it is what it is.

<h1 id="input-description">1. Input description</h1>

<p>
astgen input files are free-form (all whitespace is treated the same),
like C++ itself, and the syntax is inspired by C++ in other ways as
well.  In particular, Emacs' c++-mode works fine for highlighting.

<p>
For an example ast description, see <a href="ast.ast">ast.ast</a>.

<p>
The input file is a sequence of three kinds of things:
<ul>
<li>verbatim code to be copied to the output
<li>options
<li>tree class definitions
</ul>

<h2 id="verbatim">1.1 Verbatim</h2>

<p>
Verbatim code is exactly what it sounds like: a string that gets
copied to either the generated header file (for "verbatim") or
the generated C++ implementation file (for "impl_verbatim").  The
verbatim code is delimited by braces ("{}").

<h2 id="options">1.2 Options</h2>

<p>
There are currently two options:
<ul>
<li><code>visitor</code>: Emit code for traversal using a visitor.  See Section 3.
<li><code>gdb</code>: To make it easier to call <code>debugPrint()</code>
    from with a debugger (such as gdb), emit methods called
    <code>gdb()</code> that just call <code>debugPrint(cout,0)</code>.
</ul>

<h2 id="tree-class-definitions">1.3 Tree class definitions</h2>

<p>
A tree class definition begins with the keyword "class", then the
class name, then an optional constructor (hereafter: "ctor") argument
list, then a brace-delimited body:

<pre>
  class MyClass (int arg1, AnotherClass arg2) {
    // ... the body ...
  }
</pre>

<p>
If there are no ctor arguments, either use "()" or leave out the
parentheses entirely.

<p>
If there is nothing to put in the class body, you can abbreviate
"{}" as ";".  Note that if you put the braces, there is *not* a
semicolon following the "}".

<h3 id="ctor-arguments">1.3.1 Constructor ("ctor") Arguments</h3>

<p>
Ctor arguments play two roles.  First, they become parameters to
the generated class' constructor function.  Thus, (above) any time
a MyClass is constructed, the caller has to supply two arguments
of the given types.  Ctor arguments may be given default values
using the usual C++ syntax, in which case those become default values
for the associated constructor parameters.

<p>
Second, ctor arguments become fields in the generated class, and
those fields are initialized by the constructor call.  So a MyClass
has (at least) two fields, an int and an AnotherClass.

<p>
Actually, the above is a bit of a lie, if AnotherClass is another one
of the tree classes defined in the same astgen input file.  astgen
recognizes several special forms of ctor argument types, and each has
slightly different semantics.  In each case below, "A" is the name of
a class defined elsewhere in the astgen input file (or one of the
extensions it has been combined with, see Section 2).

<p>
<b>Tree:</b> If the type is "A", then the constructor argument and class
field are both of type "A*" (pointer to A).  Further, the class is
regarded as the owner of this pointer, and thus will deallocate it in
its destructor.

<p>
<b>Tree pointer:</b> If the type is "A*", then the argument and field are
both "A*", and the pointer is non-owning.  However, astgen recognizes
that it knows how to traverse into such a field, which comes into
play during visiting.

<p>
<b>ASTList:</b> If the type is "ASTList&lt;A&gt;"
(see <a href="../smbase/astlist.h">smbase/astlist.h</a>), then the
constructor argument becomes "ASTList&lt;A&gt;*" and the field is
"ASTList&lt;A&gt;".  ASTList has a constructor which accepts a pointer to
another ASTList, and <em>deallocates</em> the argument list, taking ownership
of the argument list's elements.  This makes it possible to create an
ASTList on the heap, pass it around as a simple pointer, and then
consume it by passing to a class with an ASTList-typed ctor arg.

<p>
<b>FakeList:</b> If the type is "FakeList&lt;A&gt;" (see smbase/fakelist.h), then
the constructor argument and class field are both "FakeList&lt;A&gt;*".
This is really just a pointer to an A, but the class is considered to
own the whole list, not just the first element.

<p>
<b>Anything else:</b> For any other type T, the argument is type T and
the field is type T.  astgen doesn't do anything special since it
assumes it doesn't know how to interact with the type.

<h3 id="fields">1.3.2 Fields</h3>

<p>
Classes can be given fields (and in fact methods) that astgen doesn't
interpret.  These don't become part of the constructor parameter list,
so they should either have or be given default values.  Fields are
introduced with one of the keywords "public", "private", or "protected",
and the end with a semicolon.  Semicolons can appear
in the field text, as long as they're bracketed by braces, parentheses,
or brackets (the lexer counts nested delimiters when looking for the
final ";").

<p>
The keywords "public", "private", and "protected" are all treated the
same way: the output class will contain the field text, prepended with
"public:" (or whatever the keyword was).  Syntactically they work
similarly to Java class fields.

<p>
Optionally, the introducer keyword can be immediately followed (no
whitespace) by a comma-separated list of field modifiers, in
parentheses.  The field modifiers are:
<ul>
<li><code>field</code>: Signals that the member is a data field, which
    currently only means that it is printed during debugPrint along
    with the constructor arguments.
<li><code>func</code>: Indicates that the declaration is a function; this
    is rarely needed.
<li><code>owner</code>: For pointers, this means that the destructor
    should delete the object pointed to.
<li><code>virtual</code>: First, adds the "virtual" keyword to the emitted
    declaration.  Then, it adds declarations for overriding implementations
    of the function to all subclasses.
</ul>
For example:
<pre>
  public(field) int w;             // 'w' gets printed by debugPrint
  protected(virtual) int foo();    // 'foo' declared in subclasses too
  private(owner) int *p;           // 'p' deleted by destructor
</pre>

<p>
Also optionally, before the final semicolon, an initializing expression
can be provided.  This expression will be used to initialize the data
member in the constructor.  Also, if the "virtual" modifier is used,
this will be applied to the declaration of a function, to make it
a "pure virtual" function.
<pre>
  public int x = 3;                // 'x' initialized to 3 in constructor
  public(virtual) int bar() = 0;   // 'bar' pure in superclass
</pre>

<p>
The declaration of <code>bar</code> above could also be written
<pre>
  pure_virtual int bar();
</pre>
as <code>pure_virtual</code> is syntactic sugar for a public, virtual
(automatic declarations in subclasses) field that is pure in the
superclass.


<h3 id="custom-code">1.3.3 Custom Code</h3>

<p>
astgen can insert user-specified code at key points in the code it
emits.  This is useful for doing some processing with the otherwise
uninterpreted fields (the fields astgen doesn't know how to process).
The user specifies such code by saying

<pre>
  custom &lt;kind&gt; { /* ...code... */ }
</pre>

<p>
The &lt;kind&gt;, lexically just an identifier, controls where this code
gets inserted.  The kinds recognized by default are:

<ul>
<li><code>debugPrint</code>: Inserted into the <code>debugPrint</code> method after the
    header is printed.

<li><code>preemptDebugPrint</code>: Inserted into <code>debugPrint</code> before anything
    else is printed.

<li><code>clone</code>: Inserted into the <code>clone</code> method.

<li><code>traverse</code>: Inserted into the <code>traverse</code> method.
</ul>

<p>
If you specify a <code>&lt;kind&gt;</code> which is not among these, nor a custom
kind as discussed next, you'll get an error when <code>astgen</code> runs.


<h3 id="user-defined-custom-code">1.3.4 User-defined custom code kinds</h3>

<p>
In order to allow a base module to define some behavior, and an <a
href="#extension-modules">extension module</a> to extend that behavior,
the user can define new <code>&lt;kind&gt;</code>s with the
<code>define_customizable</code> construct:

<pre>
  define_customizable &lt;declaration&gt; ;
</pre>

<p>
where <code>&lt;declaration&gt;</code>
is the C++ member declaration of a method to define on the class whose
name is not among the <code>&lt;kind&gt;</code>s recognized by default.
For example:

<pre>
  // Define a new "custom" kind called "preprint".
  define_customizable void preprint(PrintEnv &amp;env) const;
</pre>

<p>
Syntactically, <code>&lt;declaration&gt;</code> must match the following
regular expression:

<pre>
      word boundary     only '(' character
           |                    |
  ^([^(;]+)\b([a-zA-Z0-9_]+)\s*(\([^(;]+)$
   +------+  +-------------+   +--------+
   rettype     method name     params, etc.
</pre>

<p>
That is, there must be exactly one left-parenthesis character, and the
identifier to its immediate left is treated as the method name, with
text to the left of that (beyond the <code>\b</code> word boundary
marker) being the return type, and text to the right
being the parameter list.
(These restrictions exist so
<code>astgen</code> can separate out the method name without fully
parsing C++ syntax.)
The method name acts as the <code>&lt;kind&gt;</code>
for a subsequent <code>custom</code> directive.

<p>
The emitted definition of the method so declared is the concatenation of
the <code>custom</code> texts, starting with that in the base module
(if any).  (Note: That means the only practical return type, for now, is
<code>void</code>.)  It is declared with <code>public</code> access control.

<p>
<b>Example</b>: In a base module, we have:

<pre>
class TypeSpecifier {
  define_customizable void preprint(PrintEnv &amp;env) const;
}
</pre>

<p>
Then in an extension module, we have:

<pre>
class TypeSpecifier {
  public void preprint_attrSpecList(PrintEnv &amp;env) const;
  custom preprint { preprint_attrSpecList(env); }
}
</pre>

<p>
When <code>astgen</code> runs with the extension module active, the C++
header file output will contain:

<pre>
class TypeSpecifier {
  public: public void preprint_attrSpecList(PrintEnv &amp;env) const;
  public: void preprint(PrintEnv &amp;env) const;
};
</pre>

<p>
and the implementation file output will contain:

<pre>
void TypeSpecifier::preprint(PrintEnv &amp;env) const
{
  preprint_attrSpecList(env);
}
</pre>

<p>
In contrast, if the extension module is not active, the body of
<code>TypeSpecifier::preprint</code> is empty.


<h3 id="subclasses">1.3.5 Subclasses</h3>

<p>
The classes form a two-level hierarchy.  Subclasses are introduced
with "<code>-&gt;</code>" inside the superclass body.  The syntax following "<code>-&gt;</code>"
is identical to what follows "class".

<p>
If a class has subclasses, then the superclass is abstract (you
can't instantiate it).  Further, most of the generated methods
are virtual, so subclass implementations will be used.

<p>
Superclasses with subclasses get some additional methods, useful
for interrogating the type at run-time (this is essentially an
alternative to the C++ language's RTTI mechanism).

<p>
First, the superclass declares an enum called "Kind", with one value
for each subclass, where the name is obtained by capitalizing all the
subclass name's letters.  Then a pure virtual method "kind()" is
declared, and the subclass implementations return their Kind.

<p>
Then, for each subclass "Foo" you get:
<pre>
  bool isFoo() const;
  Foo *asFoo();                // checked downcast
  Foo const asFooC() const;    // checked downcast, const version
</pre>

<p>
The generated header file obtains these functions through the
<code>DECL_AST_DOWNCASTS</code> macro, defined in
<a href="asthelp.h">asthelp.h</a>.


<h3 id="last-ctor-parameters">1.3.6 "Last" Ctor Parameters</h3>

<p>
Occasionally, it is convenient for a ctor parameter to be supplied with
the superclass (so that all subclasses have it) but desirable to pass
and print the value <em>after</em> the subclass parameters.  For
example, a superclass Foo might want to have a "Foo *next" to form a
linked list, but we would want "next" to be at the end of all subclass
argument lists, printed last (so the list is printed in the "logical"
order), etc.

<p>
The syntax for this is a second parameter list in the superclass:
<pre>
  class Foo (/*first*/ int x, int y) (/*last*/ Foo next) {
    -> F_one(int z);
    ...
  }
</pre>
In this example, "x" and "y" are ordinary ("first") ctor parameters,
and "next" is a "last" parameter.  For example, to construct an instance
of "F_one", write
<pre>
  new F_one(x, y, z, next)
</pre>


<h2 id="miscellaneous">1.4 Miscellaneous</h2>

<p>
Comments are either C++-style "//" or C-style "/**/" form.

<p>
Some things are keywords, used to aid parsing.  Keywords currently
include:
<pre>
  class
  public
  private
  protected
  verbatim
  impl_verbatim
  ctor
  dtor
  pure_virtual
  custom
  define_customizable
  option
</pre>

<p>
You cannot use a keyword as the name of a class, or a data member,
or in any other way besides as that keyword.


<h1 id="extension-modules">2. Extension Modules</h1>

<p>
Tree structures often consist of a base definition and then one or
more annotation systems on top of the base.  Rather than clutter the
base with the annotations (making it hard to re-use the base for other
projects), annotations should be collected into extension modules.

<p>
The extension system is very simple.  You supply additional astgen
input files on the command line, and the extensions are simply
unioned with the base in the obvious way:
<ul>
<li>ctor args are appended
<li>fields are added
<li>class names that don't exist in the base define new classes
</ul>

<p>
There can be multiple extension modules, and they are added in the
order specified on the command line.


<h1 id="visitor-interface">3. Visitor Interface</h1>

<p>
If the input file includes an option of the form
<pre>
  option visitor &lt;name&gt;;
</pre>

<p>
Then a visitor implementation will be generated, and &lt;name&gt; used as
the name of the interface class.

<h2 id="interface-class">3.1 The Interface Class</h2>

<p>
The visitor interface class declares two virtual functions for
each superclass "Foo" in the astgen input:
<pre>
  bool visitFoo(Foo *obj);
  void postvisitFoo(Foo *obj);
</pre>
visitFoo is called in pre-order (before any children are visited)
and postvisitFoo is called in post-order.  If visitFoo returns
false, then its children are not visited and postvisitFoo is not
called.

<h2 id="traversal-functions">3.2 The Traversal Functions</h2>

<p>
Each tree class is given a method:
<pre>
  void traverse(&lt;name&gt; &amp;vis);
</pre>
where &lt;name&gt; is the visitor interface class name.  You can start
a visiting traversal by saying "<code>node-&gt;traverse(vis)</code>" where "vis"
is an object that implements the visitor interface.  This function
is virtual if the class in question has children (subclasses).
